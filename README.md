# Study Time vs. Scores: Analyzing the Correlation

## Project Overview

This project aims to investigate the relationship between the number of hours students dedicate to studying and their academic performance. By analyzing data on study habits and corresponding scores, we seek to determine whether there is a significant correlation between these two variables. This analysis will help educators, students, and researchers understand how study time influences academic success and provide insights into optimizing study strategies for better outcomes.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on students' study hours and their corresponding academic scores from reliable sources.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Process the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to uncover initial patterns, trends, and insights.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods to analyze the correlation between study hours and scores.
5. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to effectively communicate the findings.
6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**: Draw conclusions based on the analysis and provide actionable recommendations for students and educators.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project will include:

- **Study Hours**: Number of hours each student spends studying per week.
- **Scores**: Academic scores or grades obtained by each student.


## Technologies and Tools

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning and statistical analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for conducting the analysis.
